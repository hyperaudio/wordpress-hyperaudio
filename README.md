A WordPress plugin to display [Interactive Transcripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_transcripts)

Interactive Transcripts help make audio and video more accessible, easier to navigate, search, index and share. Some examples can be found here: [https://lab.hyperaud.io/mozfest2021/interviews/](https://lab.hyperaud.io/mozfest2021/interviews/)

You can make Interactive Transcripts with the [Hyperaudio Lite Editor](https://github.com/hyperaudio/hyperaudio-lite-editor)

## Getting started

1. [Download the ZIP file](https://github.com/hyperaudio/wordpress-hyperaudio/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) from the GitHub repository. It's recommend you rename the ZIP file to the folder name you would like the plugin to appear in, usually `hyperaudio.zip`.
2. Install the plugin. Either:
   - Using the WordPress Admin
     1. While logged into the target site, navigate to the **Plugins** page, usually `/wp-admin/plugins.php`
     2. Click the **Add New Plugin** button. This will take you to the **Add New Plugins** page.
     3. Click the **Upload Plugin** button. This will open a prompt with a file selector.
     4. Using the file selector, select the ZIP file you downloaded, and then click **Install Now**. WordPress should automatically put the plugin files in place.
   - Move the files manually
     1. Unzip the ZIP file you downloaded.
     2. Copy the resulting directory into the plugins folder of your WordPress installation, usually found at `wp-content/plugins/`.
