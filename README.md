# Hyperaudio for Wordpress
A wordpress plugin to display [Interactive Transcripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_transcripts)

Interactive Transcripts help make audio and video more accessible, easier to navigate, search, index and share. Some examples can be found here: [https://lab.hyperaud.io/mozfest2021/interviews/](https://lab.hyperaud.io/mozfest2021/interviews/)
